            <p>
                The school MHS "Gosho Vikentiev" is founded with a decision of the people's board in Kocani on 5th December 1959 as an industrial school with practical training. Until the forming to the level of school, everything was done in the basement of the school building. Metal blacksmiths were trained, metalworkers, locksmiths and locksmiths. In the school year 1962/63 the school started its own building in the now elementary school "Malina Popivanova".
                <br>
                In the seventies is started the first electrical engineering profession, direction electrical technician energy expert. Then the school grows into the first Electromachine street center in the eastern part of Macedonia, covering students from Gevgelija to Delchevo. The number of classes is more than fifteen. In the eighties of the last century, the school increased to more than thirty classes. The mechanical profession is completed with all the necessary profiles, the profile is added to the electrical one electrical installer and installer, the graphic profession was introduced, as well as the profile of drivers in the traffic profession.
                <br>
                In parallel with the growth of qualified teaching staff, a decision for a new school building is made by the Assembly of Municipality of Kocani. The new school building, the current one, was put into use on September 1, 1985. According to the needs of industrial facilities in the nineties of the last century, "Ruen", "Hartija", "Atom", "Pecatnica", etc., the profiles are opened: chemical-technological profession, masonry-facades, new profiles of the graphic profession. Today the school has 1278 students in 38 classes, in three professions (traffic, mechanical and electrical), and 11 profiles. The teaching is conducted by 67 professors organized in 7 professional assets. Every student is enabled, in addition to receiving a student diploma upon completion of school, to also obtain a driver's license. Since its establishment until today, the school has been growing in terms of the number of students, teachers, and so on professional profiles, modern teaching technology, space and modern curricula. Especially with the entry into the new millennium, there is a further modernization of teaching with completing and redirecting to new profiles of three-year and four-year education in electrical, mechanical and traffic professions. The last open profiles in the four-year-old education are "computer management technician" (mechanical profession), "electrical computer technician technology and automation "(electrical profession) and" transport and forwarding technician "(traffic profession).
                <br>
                With the current capacity we count 42 classes. The school has a sports hall with modern infrastructure, sports fields, asphalt testing ground and ecologically arranged school yard. In parallel with formal education, we follow the needs of young people for their factoring in the society. We implement those activities through the youth organization "Avangarda" and the office for career development. The three key features of the functioning of the school are the staff structure, the modern office teaching and development component. It gives the image of a desirable school for learning and working in the region. The school builds partnerships with other schools in the country and abroad, with companies and other social partners in the country. Multidisciplinary development in the field of automation, robotics and innovation, as well as the remarkable successes that our students achieve in competitions from domestic and international level, give us hope that the high school "Goso Vikentiev" still has something to show in the coming period. The school has 20 specialized classrooms - cabinets for quality performance of theoretical teaching, 5 workshops for narrower practical teaching, 5 specialized cabinets for practical teaching and car service. We have a European standard of usable area per student of 9.72 m2. There are very functional hallways, stairwells, bathrooms and other ancillary rooms in the school building. Eight offices are sufficient for the management staff, the pedagogical service and the administration. There is enough warehouse and storage space of the school. Continuous project work is a feature of modern teaching in specialized classrooms, classrooms, applicable practice in own workshops and teamwork in research and promotion of curriculum and syllabus.
